Two great continents, one an advanced civilization driven by progress and technology the other, where nature is the center of all existence and everyone lives harmoniously side by side. Two cultures that have never had contact with each other…until now.

An ancient evil has been unleashed.
Journey on a quest through time to unravel the mysterious tale of the Dark Cloud.

Innovative new gameplay, GEORAMA.
Build it—build a customized world. Play it—interact with the world in real-time. Live it—build the worlds and unveil clues and pieces of the storyline.

Six playable team members each with their own unique abilities, weapons, skills and strengths.

Detailed weapon system allows you to change and increase your weapons strength and damage.

In The fourth volume lists, dictionaries & tuples are introduced in very interactive ways and open up more opportunities for more vast ways to store
values and data in more efficient ways! Don't worry this does not mean things will get harder but make the coding process way easier for you to
understand and make your code more organized than it was before. Lists are able to store variables, values of any data type between it's '[]' and
so does dictionaries and tuples, although tuples use an optimization process behind the scenes that make your code run faster there are no wrong
answers. You will learn alot of new functionalities in this project demo and advance to unlock your full potential in programming as a whole. Various
methods, functions, tips and tricks to use in your coding to get a better understanding of python and fully diverse yourself into the code!

ex. 1-3
['cat', 9, 1.1, True, None] #  a list containing various data types

ex. 2-3
{'cat', 9, 1.1, True, None} #  a dictionary containing various data types⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

ex. 2-3
('cat', 9, 1.1, True, None) #  a tuple containing various data types⠀
