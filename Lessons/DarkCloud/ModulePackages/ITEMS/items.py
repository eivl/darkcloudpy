Loggers are a fundamental part of coding and this logger is a great entry point for beginner's and pros alike
pop this into your code to have the logger track events. Ready with all the bell's and whistle's start logging your
program now! Logging information will tell it to check for exceptions and errors that occur within your program you can check the 
log files and see whats wrong. It's very important to have them in your software or games as well. The general rule is learn about 
loggers as much as you can from my pack and see if you can create your very own loggers!

Several items can be inserted into an active item slot in Dark Cloud. 
The Auto Repair Powder will automatically repair equipped weapons that are about to break, which is convenient as they are otherwise permanently lost
if an accident occurs. The Stand-in Powder will allow you to switch characters if one is defeated in battle. The Revival Powder will automatically revive
your current character. All powders can be purchased from shops, except for the Powerup Powder, which is rare enough that it can only be found 
on back floor chests or in miracle chests.

Available shops for all purchasable powders are Gaffer's Buggy, Wise Owl Shop, Rando's Shop, Jack's Weapon Store, 
Brooke's Item Shop, Ledan's Item Shop, and the Fairy King's Item Shop. Lana's Store also sells powders, 
but not the Auto Repair or Escape variants. And aside from the aforementioned store, Stand-in Powders can also be bought at Ruty's Store.

Recovery items are consumable items which restore hit points and abnormal status in Dark Cloud and Dark Chronicle. Health items typically appear as 
simple food items, which heal small amounts, ranging to more complex and larger types of food that in turn heal larger amounts. Some types of food
have a minor negative side effect, such causing the thirst status. Water-based items on the other hand exist to fill the thirst meter exclusive to 
Dark Cloud, where as in Dark Chronicle they only heal the aforementioned thirst status.

Lastly are status restoring items, most of which heal either one specific condition or all of them at once, such as the rare Mighty Healing. 
Stamina Drink is technically not a recovery item and instead grants a temporary statistical power-up, but does actually cure status conditions 
completely once it wears off. Note that a few of the status-restoring items can also be used offensively against monsters, making them throwing items.

To use a recovery item, select it and drag it to the intended recipient, who must be hurt or under a status effect for it to work. 
It is also possible to place any recovery item in an active item slot, which will allow you to use it during combat at will. Most of these items 
can be typically found inside shops, treasure chests, miracle chests, by stealing from monsters, or slaying those that drop any.p
