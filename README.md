In The fourth volume learn lists, dictionaries & tuples are introduced in very interactive ways and open up more opportunities for more vast ways to store values and data in more efficient ways! Don't worry this does not mean things will get harder but make the coding process way easier for you to understand and make your code more organized than it was before. Lists are able to store variables, values of any data type between it's '[]' and so does dictionaries and tuples, although tuples use an optimization process behind the scenes that make your code run faster there are no wrong answers. You will learn alot of new functionalities in this project demo and advance to unlock your full potential in programming as a whole. Various methods, functions, tips and tricks to use in your coding to get a better understanding of python and fully diverse yourself into the code!
